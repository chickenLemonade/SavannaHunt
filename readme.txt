the game is a lion chasing its prey around a field

the lion is like pacman
the prey are like the fish

when the lion touches prey, it says something

everytime the lion touches its prey, add 1 to the score

__________STEPS:____________

_1 make background
_2 get pic of prey
_3 make prey code(randomly runs around)
_4 get pic of lion
_5 make lion code(move with keys)
_6 make collision code

__________OPTIONAL:____________

_7 in collision code, take away prey when _collision is detected

_8 make text in the top left of screen with score
_9 when collision is detected add 1 to score


________END:__________

Looks like we are almost done.

to add some competition to the game, this is what I have to do next:

1 add a hunter pic(should be biggest looking and largetst range of speed)


2 make a hunter class
3 hunter class randomly runs around(like prey)



4 when hunter touches lion, loose hp
  - lion starts with 10 hp
  - if hunter touches lion, -3 hp
  - if lion eats prey, +1 hp
  - if hp <= 0, game over screen
